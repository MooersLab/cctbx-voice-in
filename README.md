# Voice-triggered code snippets for the computational crystallography toolbox (cctbx)

Voice In Plus is a Chrome and Edge plugin that works in any text area in web browsers, including Jupyter notebooks.
It uses the web browser's speech-to-text software to convert your spoken words into text.
It is not using a remote server so latency is not a big issue.
Voice In Plus allows you to add text replacements.
We have mapped `voice triggers` to code chunks for the CCTBX Python package.
You say the voice trigger and the corresponding code chunk is inserted into the coat cell in the Jupyter notebook.
Hit control-return to run the cell.
